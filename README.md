Styled with Tailwind in Styled Components

 _I love Tailwind css, and using it with Styled components, was really enjoyable. The components are "clear", still I'm able to use my favorite css framework!_
 
 I know, there are many things, what I should fix, but the main target here is the cooperation between the Tailwind css and Styled components...
